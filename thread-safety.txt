This hashmap supports 4 key operations:

- insert
- delete
- lookup
- resize

Resize is only allowed to occur in the master thread due to difficulties
resising a table (a large operation) without causing large bottlenecks or
having large blocking times in multithreaded sections of a program using 
this class.

Each bucket in the hashmap is lockable; as such multiple threads can write
to multiple locations in the map at once. This is achieved by giving each
bucket a std::mutex to lock when a thread needs to access this bucket.

This way the table is thread-safe yet concurrent to a strong degree.
